# lifecycle_app
A new Flutter application that shows the  lifecyle of application.
We used WidgetBinding to register the Lifecylce of an App, and there are four lifecycle for Flutter App:

1- inactive – The application is in an inactive state and is not receiving user input.

2- paused – The application is not currently visible to the user, not responding to user input, and running in the background.

3- resumed – The application is visible and responding to user input.

4- suspending – The application will be suspended momentarily.
